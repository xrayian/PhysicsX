Hello World!

Also I added a GUI using PySimpleGUI

PhysicsX is for doing time consuming Physics Equations with one simple program.
I wish to improve it with multiple different support files that cover many different types of physics problems.
I'm new to this and hope you guys test this and provide some feedback. 

Feel free to modify this and do what your heart desires.
